# README

This document provides a brief overview of several key TypeScript concepts.


## Basic Types in TypeScript

TypeScript includes several basic types like `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and `any`.

## Interfaces, Classes, and Functions

Interfaces in TypeScript are powerful ways to define contracts within your code. Classes are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming. Functions are the building blocks of readable, maintainable, and reusable code.

## Working with the DOM and TypeScript

TypeScript can interact with the DOM by using types and interfaces provided by TypeScript's DOM type definitions.

## Generic Types

Generics provide a way to make components work with any data type and not restrict to one data type.

## Namespaces

Namespaces are used to group related code. This is a great way to help organize your code and make it more readable.

## Merging Declarations

TypeScript allows merging of interfaces, namespaces, and module declarations.

## Using an Ambient Namespace to Import an External Library

Ambient namespaces are a TypeScript concept that allows you to use modules as if they were namespaces.

## Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript

Nominal typing is a system where types are checked based on their names rather than their structure.
